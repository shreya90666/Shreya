    <p><pre><b><center>Education is a quiet lantern that keeps widening its glow the more you feed it.
         It doesn’t sit in a classroom;
          it travels with you like a loyal pocket-compass,
           nudging you toward sharper questions and braver choices 🎒✨.

It teaches you how to decode the world’s patterns,
 from the logic tucked inside circuits to the poetry hiding in everyday conversations.
  Sometimes it feels like climbing a staircase that rearranges itself as you step
  , but each rise makes you a little taller inside.

Good education isn’t just about marks.
 It’s about learning how to think instead of what to think.
  It’s curiosity turning into confidence, confusion turning into clarity,
   and effort turning into skill. It shapes communities, shifts destinies,
    and builds cities long before a single brick is laid.

And the best part? Anyone can begin.
 Anyone can continue. Education never shuts its door;
  it simply waits for the next question you dare to ask. 📚🌟</b></pre></center>
