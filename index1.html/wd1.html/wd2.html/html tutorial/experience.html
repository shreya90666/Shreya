    <h2><u>EXPERIENCE</u></h2></CENTER>
    <p><PRE><b><CENTER>Experience is a patient sculptor 🪨✨
         shaping you with every moment you live. 
        Some experiences arrive like warm sunlight,
         teaching gently and giving you confidence 🌤️.
          Others burst in like unexpected thunderstorms, 
          loud but honest, revealing strengths you didn’t know were waiting inside ⚡🌧️.

        Each moment you go through becomes a small treasure
     tucked into your inner toolkit 🎒💫. 
        Mistakes turn into stepping stones,
         achievements into fuel, and challenges into quiet wisdom.
         Bit by bit, you grow sharper, calmer, and more aware of the world’s patterns.

    What makes experience powerful is that it never wastes anything.
     Every laugh, setback, risk, success, fear,
      and triumph adds another layer to who you are 🌱🌟. 
      In time, all these moments gather into 
      a glowing map inside you, guiding your steps while you keep moving forward 🚶‍♀️💛.</CENTER></b>
