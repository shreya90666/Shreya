    <h2><u><center>PROJECTS</center></u></h2>
    <PRE><B><CENTER>Projects are little worlds you build with your own hands 🌍✨.
         Each one begins as a spark of curiosity,
          then grows into a blueprint of ideas, trials, fixes,
           and tiny victories. They invite you to experiment, stumble, adjust, and rise again — a creative adventure disguised as work 🎒🔧.

        A good project teaches you more than the final result ever shows.
         You learn how to think through problems like a detective 🕵️‍♀️,
          organize your thoughts like an architect 📐, and bring everything together like a storyteller weaving the last thread 🎭.

        And the best part? Every project you complete becomes a milestone in your journey — a bright marker that whispers, *“Look how far you’ve come.”* ⭐🚀
